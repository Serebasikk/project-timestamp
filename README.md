# Timestamp Microservice

This project is a simple web application written in Node.js using the Express.js framework. The main file for the project is index.js.

## Project structure

- index.js: The main additional file, where Express.js is configured, routes are created and the server is launched.
- public/: Directory for static files such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, which can be interacted with on the client side.

## Deposits

- express: A framework for creating web add-ons on Node.js.
- dotenv: Package for importing variable media from the .env file.
- cors: Package for processing CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) requests.

## Server Tuning:

Installing Express and using CORS for secure testing of your API is removed.
Setting up static files, like the server, if the koristuvach has reached the root path (/).

## Routes

The head route / sends the index.html file in the public/ directory.
API route /api/:date? accepts a date parameter (or we can leave it out) and rotates the object with Unix timestamp and UTC date format. If the date parameter is not entered or is in an incorrect format, the object is rotated with the “Invalid Date” mark.

## Starting the server

The server listens on the specified port (which is installed at the rear end) or on port 3000 for installation.
